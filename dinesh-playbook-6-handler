# some important points about handlers
#1) they will execute only after completion of all the main tasks
#2) they will execute in sequence 
#3) if we call same handlers multiple times then it will execute only one time
#4) A handler should have a globally unique name in the playbook
#5) if multiple handlers are defined with same name then only one handler will be called.
